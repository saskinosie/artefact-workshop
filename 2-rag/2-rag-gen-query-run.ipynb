      "Airplanes fly primarily because of their wings, which are designed to create a force called lift. Lift is crucial because it works against gravity, allowing the plane to rise into the air. Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "When the airplane moves forward, air flows around the wings. The shape of the wings causes the air to move faster over the top of the wing than underneath it. According to Bernoulli's principle, the faster-moving air on top creates lower pressure compared to the higher pressure on the bottom of the wing. This pressure difference generates lift, pushing the airplane upwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wings often have movable panels called flaps located on the back. When flaps are extended, they increase the size of the wing, allowing it to generate more lift. However, using flaps also adds drag, which is the resistance against the forward motion. This is helpful during takeoff and landing because flaps enable the plane to fly slower without stalling.\n",
      "\n",
      "The airplane also uses propellers to help move air over the wings. Propellers push air backward, which in turn propels the plane forward. This movement is essential for generating lift, as the wings rely on fast airflow to create the pressure difference needed for flight.\n",
      "\n",

Lift can also be explained using Bernoulli's principle; since wings are designed so that air goes faster on the top of the wing than on the bottom, the higher pressure on the bottom will push the plane up.

      "1. **Increased Efficiency**: Automation can lead to smooth, semi-automatic performance, as tasks shift from conscious, difficult steps to more effortless execution with mastery (as mentioned in the concept of procedural knowledge).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Parallel Processing**: Automation can handle multiple tasks simultaneously through techniques like parallelization, making it possible to work on several problems at once, which can significantly reduce completion time.\n",

      "3. **Knowledge Management**: Technology can implement memoization and common subexpression elimination, which save previous answers and optimize code by recognizing repetitive elements, improving overall performance and decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cons of Automation Using Computer\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Dependency on Specialized Drivers**: Automation can be hindered by the need for specific device drivers, such as those required for joystick input. This can make the use of automated systems time-consuming, operating system-dependent, and limit usability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Shift from Conscious to Unconscious Control**: As processes become more automated, they may rely on unconscious knowledge, potentially leading to a lack of conscious engagement with tasks, which can be a drawback if higher-level awareness and critical thinking are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complexity in Implementation**: Automation can involve complex methods like lazy evaluation, which might not always yield immediate results and can complicate the understanding of processes and their outcomes.\n",

      "CPUs, or central processing units, function as the main component of a computer that carries out instructions from programs through various operations and calculations. An important part of the CPU is the execution unit, which performs specific tasks and may include its own internal control sequence unit and registers, as well as additional components like a sub-ALU (arithmetic logic unit) or FPU (floating point unit).\n",

Each byte in RAM corresponds to a specific address, which typically matches the word size of the CPU— for instance, a 32-bit CPU uses 32-bit addresses. However, smaller CPUs, such as 8-bit ones, may utilize larger addresses to ensure longer program lengths.\n",

      "The performance of a CPU can be influenced by several factors, one of which is the clock rate, or the frequency at which the CPU operates. This is measured in cycles per second (hertz). While a higher clock speed is generally perceived as indicative of a faster processor, it is not the sole determining factor of performance. CPUs can differ significantly in architecture — in some instances, a single instruction can be executed in one clock cycle. For example, an Intel Core i5 from the 1st generation has a clock speed of 3.2 GHz, while a 10th generation Intel Core i5 operates at 1.6 GHz. Thus, performance comparisons should ideally be made among processors of the same brand and generation, rather than relying solely on clock speed.\n",
