      "1. **Importance of Wings**: It emphasizes that wings are crucial for flight, as they create lift, which opposes gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mechanics of Lift**: The text describes the process wherein air flows over and under the wing as the plane moves forward. The wing pushes air downward, which, due to Newton's third law (for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction), results in the plane being lifted upward.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bernoulli's Principle**: It introduces Bernoulli's principle as another way to explain lift. The wings are shaped (airfoil design) so that air moves faster over the top surface than the bottom. This difference in speed creates lower pressure on top and higher pressure underneath, contributing to lift.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Flaps**: The text also mentions the flaps that are located at the back of some wings. Flaps can be extended, increasing the wing's surface area to generate more lift, which helps the plane fly at slower speeds without stalling, especially during takeoff and landing.\n",

      "2. **Blade/Iron**: The blade, often referred to as the \"iron,\" is the critical component that does the actual cutting. It is typically made of steel, which allows it to hold a sharp edge for effectively shaving off thin layers of wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Wooden Wedge**: A wooden wedge is used to secure the blade in place within the body of the plane. This design allows for easy adjustments to the blade’s depth or angle, which is crucial for achieving different finishes on the wood.\n",

      "4. **Hammer Adjustment**: The instruction to adjust the blade by striking the plane with a hammer indicates a traditional method of fine-tuning the blade's position.

When air flows around the wing (which happens when the plane moves forward) the wing pushes air down, which in turn pushes the plane up. Lift can also be explained using Bernoulli's principle; since wings are designed so that air goes faster on the top of the wing than on the bottom, the higher pressure on the bottom will push the plane up.  Some wings have panels on the back called flaps. Flaps can be extended to make the wing bigger. This makes the wing make more lift, but also more drag. This lets the plane fly slower without stalling, so flaps are often used during takeoff and landing.\", 'title': 'Fixed-wing aircraft', 'wiki_id': '20231101.simple_4700_4', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-wing%20aircraft'}\n"
